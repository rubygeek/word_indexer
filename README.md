## Documentation on functions

Core file:

scrub - removed the funny quotes that happen to be in the Alice in Wonderland book file

text-to-token - takes a string and splits it on a word boundary or a decimal and lower cases the string 

run-indexer - uses the previous two functions and calls `frequencies` function on the map of words to get how often they appear

format-row - solely for formatting the vector of maps of word and counts

run - called when run on the command line
